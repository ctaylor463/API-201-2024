        "`R` tip: preceding a command by a question mark (e.g., `?cor`) will show documentation for that command. Sometimes this can be useful to better understand how to use a command. But it also can produce a lot of information that takes time to digest. Part of learning to code is learning how to read this type of documentation, and, additionally learning how to search the web for examples and explanations about how things work. Even expert programmers regularly read the built-in documentation and turn to the web for help. This is part of the process of coding!"
